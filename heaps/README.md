## üìñ Overview
- **Complete Binary Tree**: A Heap is always a complete binary tree.
- **Heap Property**:  
  - In a **Min Heap**, each parent node is **less than or equal** to its children.
  - In a **Max Heap**, each parent node is **greater than or equal** to its children.
- **Key Applications**:
  - Priority queues
  - Heap sort
  - Graph algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra‚Äôs shortest path, Prims's)
  - Scheduling systems

---

## üîë Core Properties
1. **Structural Property**: Complete binary tree shape - All levels are fully filled except possibly the last, which is filled from left to right.
2. **Heap Property (Min Heap)**: Every parent node's value is ‚â§ its children‚Äôs values.
3. **Efficient Operations**: O(1) to access to root element, Insertion and extraction (removal of the root) can be done in O(log n) time.
4. **Array Implementation**: Typically stored as array

## üõ†Ô∏è Basic Operations

### ‚ûï Insertion

#### How Insertion Works
1. **Insert at End**: Add the new element to the end of the heap (maintaining the complete tree property).
2. **Bubble Up (percolate up)**: Compare the new element with its parent.  
   - If the new element is smaller than its parent, swap them.
   - Continue this process until the new element is in the correct position or becomes the root.

#### Pseudocode for Insertion
```pseudo
Insert(heap, value):
    Append value to heap array
    index = last index of heap
    While index > 0:
        parent = (index - 1) // 2
        If heap[index] < heap[parent]:
            Swap(heap[index], heap[parent])
            index = parent
        Else:
            Break
```

### üïí Complexity Analysis

| Case        | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|-----------------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Best/Average/Worst** | O(log n)        | O(1)            |

---

## üîç Extraction

### How Extraction Works

1. Remove the Root: The minimum element in a Min Heap is at the root.
2. Replace Root: Replace the root with the last element in the heap.
3. Bubble Down (Heapify Down): Compare the new root with its children.
   - Swap it with the smaller child if it is greater than that child.
   - Continue until the heap property is restored.

### Pseudocode for Extraction

```pseudo
ExtractMin(heap):
    If heap is empty:
        Return null
    minValue = heap[0]
    heap[0] = heap[last index]
    Remove last element from heap
    index = 0
    While index has a left child:
        left = 2 * index + 1
        right = 2 * index + 2
        smallerChild = left
        If right exists and heap[right] < heap[left]:
            smallerChild = right
        If heap[index] > heap[smallerChild]:
            Swap(heap[index], heap[smallerChild])
            index = smallerChild
        Else:
            Break
    Return minValue
```

### üïí Complexity

## ‚öñÔ∏è Tradeoffs Analysis

### ‚úÖ Advantages
- **Optimal Extraction**: O(1) access to min/max element
- **Efficient Sorting**: Heap Sort achieves O(n log n)  
- **Space Efficient**: Array implementation uses minimal overhead  

### ‚ùå Challenges
- **Not Sorted Globally**: Only the root is guaranteed to be the smallest, the rest of the array isn‚Äôt fully sorted.
- **Fixed Order**: Only root element is directly accessible.
- **Search Limitations**: O(n) search for arbitrary elements.
- **Balance Dependency**: Heaps are inherently balanced (complete trees), but ensuring complete structure can complicate dynamic resizing.

## üß† Key Implementation Notes

### Array Representation
*Why use array?*  
 - Parent-child relationships calculable via indices
 - Index Formulas
   - Left Child: 2 * index + 1
   - Right Child: 2 * index + 2
   - Parent: (index - 1) // 2   

### Heapify Operations
- **Bubble Up**: Used after insertion to restore the heap property.
- **Bubble Down**: Used after extraction (or deletion) to re-establish the heap property. 

### Iterative vs. Recursive Approaches
- **Iterative** methods (as shown) are preferred for heaps due to their constant space (O(1)) overhead
- Recursive implementations exist but may lead to stack overflow with very large heaps

| Extract   | O(log n)   | N/A       | N/A    | N/A         |
