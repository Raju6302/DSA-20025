DSA Fundamentals Implementations

Welcome to the DSA Fundamentals Implementations repository! 🚀 This project is dedicated to implementing Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in multiple programming languages, helping developers and learners understand DSA concepts better with practical implementations.

💡 Contributing to This Repository

We welcome contributions in various programming languages! Currently, the repository includes implementations in:

Java

Python

JavaScript

You can contribute by implementing DSA problems using any other programming language, such as:

C++

Go Lang

Rust

TypeScript

Swift

Kotlin

Ruby

Any other language of your choice!

🚀 How to Contribute

Fork the Repository: Click the fork button to create a copy of the repo in your account.

Clone the Repo: Clone your forked repository to your local machine.

git clone https://github.com/Raju6302/DSA-20025.git

Create a Branch: Create a new branch for your contribution.

git checkout -b feature-your-language

Add Your Code: Implement the algorithm or data structure in your chosen language inside an appropriate folder (/C++/, /GoLang/, etc.).

Commit and Push:

git add .
git commit -m "Added message in [Language]"
git push origin feature-your-language

Create a Pull Request (PR): Open a pull request describing your changes.

🌟 Contribution Guidelines

Follow proper coding conventions for your language.

Include comments explaining the logic behind your code.

Add a README file inside your language folder (optional but appreciated).

Ensure your code runs correctly before submitting.

Avoid duplicate implementations; if an algorithm already exists in a language, try improving it instead.
