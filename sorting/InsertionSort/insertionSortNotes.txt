-------------Insertion Sort---------------


Insertion Sort is a simple and efficient sorting algorithm that works similarly to sorting playing cards in your hands. It builds the sorted array one item at a time by inserting each element into its correct position.

steps:
 1. Assume the first element is already sorted.
 2. Pick the next element and compare it with the sorted part (left side).
 3. Shift the elements larger than the picked element to the right to make space.
 4. Insert the picked element at its correct position.
 5. Repeat this process for all elements.


Time & Space Complexity:
  Best Case (Already Sorted): 𝑂(𝑛)
  Worst & Average Case: 𝑂(𝑛^2)

Space Complexity: 
  O(1) (in-place sorting, no extra memory used)
