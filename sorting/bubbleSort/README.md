📖 Overview
Sorting Algorithm: Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.

In-place: Uses constant additional space.

Stable: Maintains relative order of equal elements.

🔑 Core Properties
Comparison-Based: Compares adjacent elements.

In-Place: No need for extra memory.

Stable Sort: Does not change the order of equal elements.

Quadratic Time: Inefficient on large datasets (O(n²)).

🛠️ Basic Operations
📊 Sorting Logic
How Bubble Sort Works
Iterate over the array from the beginning.

Compare each pair of adjacent items.

If they are in the wrong order, swap them.

Repeat until the array is fully sorted.

Optimization: If no swaps are made in a pass, the array is already sorted.

BubbleSort(arr):
    for i = 0 to arr.length - 2:
        swapped = false
        for j = 0 to arr.length - 2 - i:
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                swap(arr[j], arr[j+1])
                swapped = true
        if not swapped:
            break

🕒 Complexity Analysis
Case	Time Complexity	Space Complexity
Best	O(n)	O(1)
Average	O(n²)	O(1)
Worst	O(n²)	O(1)
⚖️ Tradeoffs Analysis
✅ Advantages
Simple to implement

No extra memory required

Stable sorting algorithm

Good for educational purposes

❌ Challenges
Inefficient for large datasets

Better alternatives exist like Merge Sort, Quick Sort, or TimSort

🧠 Key Implementation Notes
Swapping Optimization
Bubble Sort minimizes unnecessary operations by checking if any swap occurred during an iteration.

Early Termination
If a pass results in no swaps, sorting is complete — allowing early exit from the loop.
